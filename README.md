# Wings of the Points

This is a chart to visually represent the transfer partnerships between rewards programs of US credit cards and airlines.

## Usage
* It is better to view this chart on desktop. The screens on mobile devices are usually too narrow to have a good effect.
* Move your mouse over the point name or airline name to highlight transfer relationships. 
* Move your mouse over any line connecting a point and a mile to see the transfer ratio. 
* The airlines are grouped by alliances, and inside an alliance the airlines are sorted by alphabetical order. 
* You can use ctrl+F (or cmd+F) to quickly find an airline.

## Note
* Chase UR is short for Chase Ultimate Rewards points; AmEx MR is short for American Express Membership Rewards points; Citi TYP is short for Citi ThankYou Points.
* The Marriott Bonvoy points can be transferred to airlines miles at 3:1 ratio with most programs. Plus, Marriott will add 5,000 miles for every 60,000 Marriott Bonvoy points you transfer to airline miles. Therefore we count the ratio as 3:1.25. It is basically equivalent to the previous SPG program (1:1.25 ratio).
